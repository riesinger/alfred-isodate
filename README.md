# alfred-isodate

This is a simple [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow to copy the current date and time into your clipboard.
The date and time will be formatted in the ISO 8601 format, e.g. `2021-11-10T21:19:05+0100`.

I often need the current time but can never remember the correct arguments for the `date` command,
so I figured it would be time for an Alfred workflow.

## How to get it

Download the `.alfredapp` file in this repository and open it. Alfred should guide you though the
installation.

## How to use it

Simply trigger alfred and type in `date`. You should see an option called "ISO Date" pop up. Just
press enter and paste the current date wherever you need it ðŸ˜Š
